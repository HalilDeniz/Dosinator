## Features

- **Multiple Attack Modes**: DoSinator supports SYN Flood, UDP Flood, and ICMP Flood attack modes, allowing you to simulate various types of DoS attacks.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the packet size, attack rate, and duration to fine-tune the intensity and duration of the attack.
- **IP Spoofing**: Enable IP spoofing to mask the source IP address and enhance anonymity during the attack.
- **Multithreaded Packet Sending**: Utilize multiple threads for simultaneous packet sending, maximizing the attack speed and efficiency.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scapy
- argparse

  -p PORT, --port PORT  Target port number.
  -np NUM_PACKETS, --num_packets NUM_PACKETS
                        Number of packets to send (default: 500).
  -ps PACKET_SIZE, --packet_size PACKET_SIZE
                        Packet size in bytes (default: 64).
  -ar ATTACK_RATE, --attack_rate ATTACK_RATE
                        Attack rate in packets per second (default: 10).
  -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                        Duration of the attack in seconds.
  -am {syn,udp,icmp,http,dns}, --attack-mode {syn,udp,icmp,http,dns}
                        Attack mode (default: syn).
  -sp SPOOF_IP, --spoof-ip SPOOF_IP
                        Spoof IP address.
  --data DATA           Custom data string to send.
```

- `target_ip`: IP address of the target system.
